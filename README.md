90398 roles will be needed to be filled with upcoming retirements coming up. 

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

There is 1549 employees by age eligibile for the mentorship program. The majority of these are senior level engineers and staff, combining for 70.8%. With the the large wave of retirments coming HP would need to expand the age of their mentorship program to higher than 1965.
